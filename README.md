# SquareTakeHome by Naga Sudheer Bolla


## Build tools & versions used
Built using latest Build tools with compile and target sdk versions 33

## Steps to run the app
Install Android Studio, latest Android SDK, emulator(or use real device for better experience) and open the project. Allow the gradle to fetch and build the
dependencies. Once done, click the run icon at the top bar or use shortcut Shift+F10

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
Just fetching the data from backend, parsing it using Moshi, displaying efficiently using MVVM architecture and writing unit tests

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
No particular problems, but Tried using Moshi instead of Gson, which I was used to previously. Just wanted to 
try the new things.

## How long did you spend on this project?
Spent around 3 hours for building the app and spent around 1-2 hours(or more due to limited visibility for me due to personal reasons)
on Unit tests.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
Would have tried latest libraries like Koin for dependency injection, coil for image loading.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Maybe UI design or test cases.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
Used following libraries:
    1. Retrofit, OkHttp, Moshi - for making API calls and parsing them efficiently
    2. Glide - for image loading and displaying
    3. Image Loading Library - Custom Library/Approach for image loading. Its a old library customised for our needs. 
    4. Couple of android official libraries.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
First of all sorry for the delay. Its been hectic for me since last couple of weeks, since I am
on vacation and had an eye surgery. Hope you do understand and accept this.
